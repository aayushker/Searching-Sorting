What is a Searching Algorithm?
Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

Different Searching Algorithm:
      Linear Search
      Sentinel Linear Search
      Binary Search
      Meta Binary Search | One-Sided Binary Search
      Ternary Search
      Jump Search
      Interpolation Search
      Exponential Search
      Fibonacci Search
      The Ubiquitous Binary Search

What is Sorting?
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

Different prominent Sorting Algorithm:
      Selection Sort
      Bubble Sort
      Insertion Sort
      Merge Sort
      QuickSort
      Heap Sort
      Counting Sort
      Radix Sort
      Bucket Sort

Time and Space complexity of different Sorting Algorithms:
